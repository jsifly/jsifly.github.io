			Hi! I am Jyoti Sawhney, and with a masters in mathematics and statistics, have been teaching various curriculums and levels of maths to students from all over Delhi since the last 20 years, with a track record of students with perfect standerdized test scores as well as board results in maths. I provide original as well as external material up to the standard, and have my center in New Friends Colony, New Delhi.

                            “ I always wanted to learn from the best. With the same thought, I started my SAT prep with The Test Pursuit. They are not only knowledgable and passionate about their subjects and teach from personal experience but also share your goal and show you the way with great enthusiasm. Their support and counselling helped me stay focussed and added tremendous value to my work. They were by far the best guidance that I could have gotten for my SAT preparation. ”

                            “ It is no doubt that The Test Pursuit has an amazing faculty. More importantly, they a really nice people who went beyond our sessions to help me with my doubts. They are the only people who was more concerned about my SAT scores than me. Moreover, as I was doing the IB, I had already covered some math topics that are required for SAT; however, there were other topics in advanced trigonometry which CBSE students cover early on in their syllabus but the IB doesn’t. To deal with my situation, the TTP team made a custom plan to help strengthen the topics I was weak at. They worked tirelessly with me as I spent more than 5 to 6 hours at their centre everyday. This eventually translated into a wonderful SAT score for me and I cannot thank The Test Pursuit enough for it. ”
